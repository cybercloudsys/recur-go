# Recur

Provides advanced functionality for calculating the timing of recurring events. You can easily use it to create simple or complex patterns for events that repeat at regular intervals, including events that occur on custom days or months. You can also customize the weekly off days to be used in the pattern, and generate a human-readable text representation of the pattern.\
It gives easy way to check if a given time matches a specific pattern, and calculate the next time that a pattern will occur.\
Recur is ideal for use in scheduling systems, task automation, and any other application that requires the precise timing of recurring events.

## Features

- Define recurrence patterns for daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly occurrences.
- Specify specific days of the week or month for recurring events.
- Handle complex recurrence scenarios with customizable options.
- Calculate the next occurrence based on the current time.
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into existing go projects.
- Serializable recurring patterns for utilization in distributed systems.

## Installation

You can install the Recur Go package by running the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/cybercloudsys/recur-go
```

## Usage

To get started with Recur, you need to create a recurrence pattern. Recur supports various recurrence patterns such as daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. Once you have defined the pattern, you can use the `NextTime` method to calculate the next occurrence.

Here's an example of creating a daily recurrence pattern:

```go
import "github.com/cybercloudsys/recur-go"

func main() {
    recurPattern := recur.Daily().Build()
    nextOccurrence := recurPattern.NextTime()
    // nextOccurrence will be the date and time of the next occurrence
}
```

In this example, we created a daily recurrence pattern that calculates the next occurrence.

You can also create more complex recurrence patterns. Here's an example of creating a recurrence pattern that occurs on the closest working day 2 days before the end of a quarter at 10:30 AM:

```go
import "github.com/cybercloudsys/recur-go"

func main() {
    recurPattern := recur.OnMonths(3, 6, 9, 12).OnDay(2).FromLastDay().OnWorkday().AtHour(10).AtMinute(30).Build()
    // Use the recurrence pattern as needed
}
```

Similarly, you can create monthly and yearly recurrence patterns with specific day or month constraints, such as the last Friday or the second Monday of every month.

These are just a few examples of the basic usage of Recur. You can explore the various options and methods provided by Recur to create more complex and customized recurrence patterns.
